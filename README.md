Temperature monitoring in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in an area with restricted access to power.
Suppose we are in a remote region or in an emergency scenario where access to electricity is limited. In such cases, medical equipment requiring continuous monitoring, such as neonatal incubators or thermal isolation chambers, needs to be operated efficiently and with special consideration for power consumption.
This code can be integrated into an embedded device, such as an ESP32 microcontroller, to monitor and send real-time ambient temperature to an MQTT server. Here's how it could be applied:
- Temperature Monitoring Device: The ESP32, equipped with temperature sensors, could be installed at different points in an ICU to monitor ambient temperature.
- Low Power Connectivity: Optimized code to connect to low-power Wi-Fi networks and periodically send data via the MQTT protocol helps ensure that the device consumes the minimum amount of energy possible.
- Communication with MQTT Server: The MQTT server could be set up on a local network with a stable power source. It would receive temperature readings from the ESP32 and could be accessed by healthcare professionals through applications or control panels.
- Alert Management: The system could be configured to send alerts if the temperature exceeds safe limits, ensuring that healthcare professionals are notified immediately in case of emergency.
This application would be useful in situations where electricity may be intermittent or difficult to access, ensuring continuous and accurate temperature monitoring in critical medical environments such as ICUs.
